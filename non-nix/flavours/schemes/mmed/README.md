# base16-schemes

This repository has been deprecated in favor of a new [schemes repository](https://github.com/tinted-theming/schemes). This repository is being archived so builders which haven't been updated yet won't break, but they will not get new scheme updates. If you would like to add a new scheme, please submit it to the new repository.

The original README can be found [here](./base16-schemes.md).

## Contributing

To submit your scheme, submit a new pull request to the [new schemes repository](https://github.com/tinted-theming/schemes) with your scheme yaml file.

## FAQ

***Where did these all come from?***

These schemes were originally imported from [the old schemes source repo](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-schemes-source) on May 25th, 2022 around 11pm UTC.

***Why is it all in one repo now?***

Spec 0.10 was merged at the same time that base16 was forked from [Chris Kempson's](https://github.com/chriskempson) account. One of the changes of this version was moving all schemes to a single repo rather than separate repos and the fork was chosen as a convenient time to do this.
